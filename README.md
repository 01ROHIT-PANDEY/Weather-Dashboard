# Weather Dashboard
I have Build an application which provides the current weather along with next 5 days Hourly Weather.

### Open Weather Api
Used Open Weather Api for fetching the current weather along with other days forecast.

### JSON Server
Used JSON Server for creating the Mock API Request to Store Some Searched City Information as a Favourite City to display the weather Information Automatically in future.


### Things to take care of before Running an Application
Make sure that you have latest Node.js version install in your System
Along with you should have a VS Code to be installed in Your System
Install JSON Server using NPM Command which is **npm install -g json-server**
